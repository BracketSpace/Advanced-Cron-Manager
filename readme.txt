**Informations about WP Cron**

Please remember - after deactivation of this plugin added Schedules will be not available. Added Events will still work.

Important - WordPress Cron is depended on the User. WP Cron fires only on the page visit so it can be inaccurate.

== Installation ==

Download and install this plugin from Plugins -> Add New admin screen.

Plugin's page sits under Tools menu item.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Tasks and schedules will be still working after plugin deactivation/removal? =

Tasks yes. Schedules no.

= How does the pausing/unpausing work =

When you pause an event it's really unscheduled and stored in the wp_option. If you unpause it, it will be rescheduled. All paused events are rescheduled on plugin uninstall.

= What is the Event hook? =

It's used for action. For example if your hook is hook_name you'll need to add in PHP:
`add_action( 'hook_name', 'function_name' )`

= Does this plugin allow to add PHP to events like in WP Crontrol plugin? =

No. This is not safe. You can, however, copy the sample implementation and paste it into you own plugin or theme's function.php file.

= Can this plugin block WP Cron and help hooking it into Server Cron like WP-Cron Control plugin? =

Yes, but WP-Cron Control is quite old and it's tactics is not needed anymore. Advanced Cron Manager can disable spawning WP Cron on site visit and will give you useful informations about added Server Cron task.
